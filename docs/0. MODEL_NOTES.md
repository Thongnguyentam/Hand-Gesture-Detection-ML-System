## Data Augmentation Techniques

To create a more robust and generalized hand gesture recognition model, the training data should be augmented. This process artificially expands the dataset by creating modified copies of existing images.

The following augmentation techniques are safe and effective for hand gesture datasets:

-   **Horizontal Flip:** Flips the image left-to-right. This is crucial as it effectively doubles the dataset for left- and right-hand gestures.
-   **Rotation:** Rotates the image slightly (e.g., within a range of -15° to +15°) to simulate different camera angles.
-   **Scale/Zoom:** Zooms in or out slightly (e.g., 90%–110%) to handle variations in distance from the camera.
-   **Brightness & Contrast:** Adjusts lighting conditions to make the model less sensitive to changes in ambient light.
-   **Translation:** Moves the image slightly up, down, left, or right to ensure the model isn't dependent on the hand being perfectly centered.
-   **Gaussian Noise:** Adds light, random noise to simulate sensor noise from a low-quality camera.
-   **Blurring:** Applies a light Gaussian blur to simulate motion blur or a slightly out-of-focus camera.
